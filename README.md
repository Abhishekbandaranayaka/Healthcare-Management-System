#Healthcare Management System Documentation

1. Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Healthcare Management System, including its architecture, services, database design, and authentication mechanisms. The system is built using Spring for the backend, PostgreSQL and MongoDB for databases, Docker for containerization, and JUnit for testing.
2. System Overview
The Healthcare Management System is designed to manage various aspects of healthcare, including patient records, doctor profiles, appointments, medical records, billing, and notifications. The system is composed of several independent microservices that communicate with each other to provide a seamless user experience.
3. Architecture
3.1 Microservices
•	Patient Service: Manages patient records, profiles, and appointments.

•	patient_id
•	message
•	notification_date

 6. Authentication and Authorization
6.1 User Registration and Login
•	Registration: Users can register with their details, which are stored in the User table in PostgreSQL.
•	Login: Users login with their credentials, and upon successful authentication, a JWT token is issued.
6.2 Token Management
•	JWT Tokens: Used for authentication and authorization. Each request to the services must include a valid JWT token.
•	Token Validation: Each service validates the token with the Authentication Service before processing the request.


6.3 Role-Based Access Control

•	Roles: Different roles (e.g., patient, doctor, admin) have different access levels.
•	Access Control: Services check the user's role to ensure they have the appropriate permissions for the requested operation.

 7. Interactions Between Services
1. User Registration**:
•	The user registers via the Authentication Service.
•	User details are stored in PostgreSQL.
2. User Login:
•	The user logs in and receives a JWT token.
•	The token is used for subsequent requests to other services.
3. Booking an Appointment:
•	The user sends a request to the Appointment Service.
•	The Appointment Service validates the token and checks the user's role.
•	The service processes the booking and stores the appointment details in PostgreSQL.
•	A notification is sent via the Notification Service.
4. Accessing Medical Records:
•	The user (doctor) requests a patient's medical records.
•	The Medical Records Service validates the token and checks the user's role.
•	The service retrieves and returns the records from MongoDB.
5. Billing:
•	The Billing Service generates a bill for the patient.
•	The bill details are stored in PostgreSQL.
•	Payments are processed, and the status is updated.
8. Testing
•	JUnit**: Used for unit testing the individual services.
•	Integration Testing**: Tests the interactions between services.
•	End-to-End Testing**: Ensures the complete system works as expected.
 9. Deployment
•	Docker: Each service is containerized using Docker.
•	Docker Compose: Used to manage multi-container Docker applications, ensuring all services run together smoothly.
